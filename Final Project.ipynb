    "## Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1)Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is all about the Python tutorial and accessing it from GitHub website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985-1990. Python source code is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is therefore an open-source tool. This tutorial will allow you to learn basic Python programming from scratch with some basis of C, Matlab or any other structured programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2)History and Basic Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. It uses English keywords frequently and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n",
    "1. Python is Interpreted: You do not need to compile your program before executing it.\n",
    "2. Python is Interactive: You can type commands directly on a line.\n",
    "3. Python is Object-Oriented: programming encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "4. Python has currently a wide range of applications and libraries available from simple text\n",
    "processing to WWW browsers to games.\n",
    "5. Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows,\n",
    "and Macintosh.\n",
    "6. Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all\n",
    "platforms.\n",
    "7. Python is extensible: modules can be added to enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more e_cient.\n",
    "8. Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\n",
    "9. Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\n",
    "10. Python can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages. Python is copyrighted but the source code is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3)Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been installed in the computers in AT4019 on the Ubuntu partition. Login into Ubuntu using your myInfo username and password. Then open a terminal window. To verify installation, type \"python\" in the command line to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in getting Python for your Windows platform you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ \n",
    "If you prefer a Linux platform you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ubuntu\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions for installation are given in those pages. But in general:\n",
    "1. Download Gzipped source\n",
    "2. Extract\n",
    "3. Con_gure and Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's Official Website is at http://www.python.org/\n",
    "You can download Python documentation from the following site.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4)Running Python\n",
    "There are three di_erent ways to start Python:\n",
    "1. Interactive Interpreter: you can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.\n",
    "2. Executing scripts: you can start a series of Python commands by typing the name of a script with those commands\n",
    "3. Using an integrated development environment\n",
    "4. Using the interactive web application Jupyter that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1) Command line\n",
    "Start coding right in the interactive interpreter.\n",
    "$python # Unix/Linux\n",
    "or\n",
    "C:>python # Windows/DOS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2)Script\n",
    "A Python script (here script.py) can be executed at command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as in the following:\n",
    "$python script.py # Unix/Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3) Integrated Development Environment \n",
    "You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python. Unix uses IDLE as a Unix IDE for Python. Windows has PythonWin as a Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI. Macintosh has either MacBinary or BinHex'd as an environment. Since the Python Programming environment is already installed ine, so that you can execute all the available examples online at the same time when you are learning theory. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 Jupyter\n",
    "We will use in the course Jupyter as our tool for Python. This allows me to show finished text and code embedded units as a notebook for class and you can download the notebooks and modify them as required to practice and complete assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5)First command in Python\n",
    "Let some Python commands using the Interactive Mode Programming first so you are familiar with some first commands to be discussed here.\n",
    "Invoke the interpreter\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "Python 3.3.2 (default, Dec 10 2013, 11:35:01)\n",
    "[GCC 4.6.3] on Linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\", or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "You will have a different prompt that shows you are now in the Python environment. Execute\n",
    "your first Python command:\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"Hello world using Python!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the classic first command in programming. You just ran your first Python command.\n",
    "If you entered that command in a text file with extension .py you could invoke the script directly and obtain the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the result for the first Python command"

    "#### 6.1) Identifiers, comments, suites and indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9). Python does not allow punctuation characters and it is a case sensitive programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers: and exec Not as finally or assert for pass break from print class global raise continue if return def import try del in while elif is with else lambda yield except.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't use braces() to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. It uses line indentation, which is rigidly enforced. The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount.\n"
